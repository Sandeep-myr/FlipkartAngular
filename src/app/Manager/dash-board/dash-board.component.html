    OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
    Our Story
    With a career in the construction industry spanning over 40 years, the founder of Project On Track, Mr. Raju,
    has extensive experience managing and handling large and complex projects of a multidiscipline nature.
    Raju used conventional tools and systems through a manual process to track construction management tasks. Soon,
    he realized that there could be a better way to manage construction using technology. So, he started identifying
    opportunities to digitize various parts of the construction business. With the belief that this could
    revolutionize the construction industry, he formulated a company and began developing software with over 20
    highly skilled developers.
    After years of development and testing, we have evolved Project on Track software. We believe this is the most
    powerful software for managing workflow in the construction industry. With role-based security access, users can
    decide who gets access to which modules. In addition, being in the cloud, this software provides access to
    real-time data anytime, anywhere in the world. Using this software, you can mitigate risks and save money by
    taking corrective action earlier in the process.
    As a company, we are dedicated to providing world-class support to our clients. With teams spread across the
    globe, we can help our clients in different time zones. In addition, with great technology partners on board, we
    are developing video-based software tutorials, so everyone can take advantage of learning this software at their
    own pace, from the comfort of their own home.
    With Project on Track, we assist our customers in remaining ahead of the competition by managing their projects
    from start to end through a cloud-based, integrated construction management platform in a multi-user
    environment. Our innovative and unique software provides easy-to-use business tools and solutions that connect
    your field operations and office in real-time. We have headquarters in Sydney, Australia, and a support office
    in India, and we are serving our customers across the globe.
